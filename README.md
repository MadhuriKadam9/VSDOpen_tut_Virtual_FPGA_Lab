# Introduction
## Makerchip Platform
Makerchip is an Open Source web based Application for verilog programming, Digital VLSI design etc. For more detail refer:</br>
https://www.makerchip.com/
## Virtual FPGA Lab
With Virtual FPGA Lab we can simulate various FPGA real boards like zedboard, Spartan, Bayses, Artrix etc using Makerchip IDE. For more details refer:</br>

# Interfacing LEDs
Following snippet shows the interfacing of the LEDs on the Virtual FPGA by writing a System Verilog code in Makerchip

# Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Mr. Steve Hoover for providing Makerschip platform and Mr. Bala Dinesh for explaining the Virtual FPGA Lab through various hands on like seven segment display interfacing and Traffic light controller. It helped me to understand the simulation of Virtual FPGAs on Makerchip Platform. It will definitely benifit students in terms of their skill enhancements on FPGAs as they can learn and do the practicals on this platform insted of buying Real FPGAs which are costly. I would also like to thank Mr. Kunlal Ghosh and Ms. Anagha Ghosh for providing and facilitating VSD-IAT platform.
